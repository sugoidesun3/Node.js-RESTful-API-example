# NODE.JS RESTFUL API (EXPRESS) EXAMPLE 1
Basically a overcomplicated todo app

- Note: proper documentation (README and comments and stuff) will only be added in the last commit, since I'm the only one developing this app and it's fairly small, so it will pretty much be for style points. After all, if the code is simple and/or well written, chances are that it explains itself (in nodejs that is).

## Abilities and stuff meant to be showed here:
- Authentication with JWT
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- File transfer
- Pagination
- Async and Await syntax (will probably be in a different branch)
- GraphQL (will definetly be in a different branch, even though it's my favourite way of doing stuff here)
- (Ironically) Relations in the database
- Heroku deploy (live version of the api)
- Maybe I can implement testing, I'll see if I have time to do this on all skill showcase repos
- Git, obviously...
(there is also the workflow, but that cannot exactly be shown through the code, but debugging isn't done with "print(1)...print(2)..print(3)", using actual debugging tools is not only easier, it is faster and more elegant.)

i dont even know why i'm writing this nobody will see it anyway........

### Should take about 6 hours or so to complete
